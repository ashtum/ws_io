Boost.WS.Io is a portable, low-level C++ library which implements the HTTP/1
protocol using Boost.Asio networking.

Boost.WS.Io offers these features:

* Require only C++11
* Fast compilation, few templates

== Requirements

* Requires Boost and a compiler supporting at least C++11
* Aliases for standard types use their Boost equivalents
* Link to a built static or dynamic Boost library, or use header-only (see below)

== Tested Compilers

Boost.WS.Io has been tested with the following compilers:

* clang: 3.8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
* gcc: 4.8, 4.9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
* msvc: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3

== Quality Assurance

The development infrastructure for the library includes these per-commit analyses:

* Coverage reports
* Compilation and tests on Drone.io and GitHub Actions

== Security Review (Bishop Fox)
